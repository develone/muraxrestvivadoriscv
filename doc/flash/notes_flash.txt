 The original Arty-A7 had a flash chip from Micron on it.  This chip is still listed as the flash chip on the schematic.  The Micron chip also had a lot of design flaws, making it difficult to guarantee that the chip could be brought to a proper reset state upon startup.  This has been a discussion on the forum.

I was recently informed that the newer A7 boards now have a Spansion flash device on them?

While I like the Spansion flash better, may I encourage you to update your schematic and other Arty documentation to reflect this?

Also, can you please share for the record what that new chip is?

Thanks!
